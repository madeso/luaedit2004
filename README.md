# luaedit2004
Like the name says, this was made in 2004 or perhaps even a year earlier not really sure. It's a basic IDE with basic syntax highlightning based on the rtf component found in software like the wordpad editor/application. It's even written in Visual Basic! Not sure if it works, not even sure if I have all the sources 15 years later but I figured it might be interesting for folks to see thatit isn't a herculian effort to write a basic IDE, even if it is a crappy one.
